This is the boof package manager, made in 24 hours for the annual Gunn Hacks competition. Boof was inspired by the Nix package manager, and was made because NixOS is annoying to use (and the Nix language is also annoying). If you like the Nix package manager, this may not be for you.

Boof uses the Nix philosophy of having multiple different versions of the same package installed at the same time. To achieve this, Boof takes advantage of the Arch Package Archive. This means that with Boof, you get the rolling edge and pinned packages by default.
